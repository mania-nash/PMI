This work estimates the pollution reduction when the taxicab fleet changes from combustion engine-powered vehicles to electric vehicles and by predicts when the next taxi pick up will happen.
By changing 15% of the fleet each month, there will be 619196678.45 grams.
The developed approach predicts when the next pick up will take place with an accuracy of 1,31 miles.
The approach seems promising but further developments can lead to more accurate predictions.
